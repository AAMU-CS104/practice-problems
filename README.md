# Practice Problems for CS 104

This is a repository of practice problems for CS 104, organized by topic. Some of these problems are sourced
from Leetcode, Hackerrank, commonly used introductory Python courses, or made up by the teaching staff. They come with problem descriptions, skeleton code, unit tests, and solutions.

Please use these problems to practice and check your understanding of the course material and ask the teaching staff if you have questions. =)
